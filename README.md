    You ended up spamming groups, getting reported left and right,
    and you ended up in a Finale Battle with Telegram and at the end
    Telegram Team deleted your account?
    And after that, then you pointed your fingers at us
    for getting your acoount deleted?
    I will be rolling on the floor laughing at you.

## What is it?

Paperplane is a modular Telegram userbot running on Python3, which can be coupled up with Mongo DB and a Redis backend.

Originally created by baalajimaestro, Paperplane is currently maintained by zakaryan2004. It started as a simple bot,
which helped with group management, with lots of features from [SkittBot](https://github.com/skittles9823/SkittBot).
It has since evolved, becoming extremely modular and simple to use.

## How do I use it?

For configuring Paperplane, you can checkout our [Wiki](https://wiki.raphielgang.org/#/paperplane/getting-started). Please, before asking us in our groups,
