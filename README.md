# Telegram-UserBot


Just coz I'm too lazy, I program it, to make stuff easier.

This is a userbot, which is equivalent to a telegram client, and it can run on the cloud too.<br/><br/>

Get your API_ID, API_HASH from my.telegram.org. <br/><br/>

Use them as config vars in Heroku<br/><br/>

Clone this and try to add features to it, make pull requests to merge it.
