# Telegram-UserBot 
[![Build Status](https://semaphoreci.com/api/v1/leviathanaxeislit/telegram-userbot/branches/master/badge.svg)](https://semaphoreci.com/leviathanaxeislit/telegram-userbot)

Just coz I'm too lazy, I program it, to make stuff easier.
This is a userbot, which is equivalent to a telegram client, and it can run on the cloud too.

### Before you start:
Get your api-id(API_KEY in my code), API_HASH from my.telegram.org.

#### Running on heroku:
<b>If you clone/fork this repo please make sure you delete session_name.session and regenerate it by running app.py on your local pc before deploying it on heroku.</b>

- Fork my repo.

- Download/Clone it in your linux PC, then follow instructions on Running on linux(below), this will generate a session_name.session file, which is needed to run your bot, push this file to your git.

- Connect your git to heroku.

- Add API_KEY and API_HASH in CONFIG VARS. 

- Deploy.

#### Running on linux:
- Clone my repo: `git clone https://github.com/baalajimaestro/Telegram-UserBot`

- Add your API_KEY and API_HASH: `export API_HASH=your-api-hash` and `export API_KEY=your-api-id`

- Start the userbot: `python3 app.py`
