# Telegram-UserBot

### If the CI builds pass, but you still get syntax errors when running locally it's most probably not a problem with the source but with your version of python


```
#include <std/disclaimer.h>
/**
    Your Telegram account may get banned.
    I am not responsible for any improper use of this bot
    This bot is intended for the purpose of having fun with memes,
    as well as efficiently managing groups.
    You ended up spamming groups, getting reported left and right,
    ended up in a Finale Battle against Telegram and at the end
    Telegram Team deleted your account?
    And after that, you pointed your fingers at us
    for getting your acoount deleted?
    I will be rolling on the floor laughing at you.

A modular telegram Python UserBot running on python3 with a mongoDB coupled with Redis backend.

Started up as a simple bot, which helps with deleting messages and other stuffs when I didn't possess a smartphone(selecting each message indeed difficult) with a ton of meme features kanged from [SkittBot](https://github.com/skittles9823/SkittBot), it has evolved, becoming extremely modular and simple to use.
